# Performance Optimization

The backend implements comprehensive performance optimizations to ensure fast response times, efficient resource usage, and reliable operation under varying load conditions.

## 🎯 Performance Strategy

Our performance approach focuses on four key areas:
- **📊 Intelligent Caching**: Strategic caching of expensive operations and external API responses
- **🗄️ Database Optimization**: Connection pooling, indexing, and query optimization
- **⚡ Asynchronous Processing**: Background tasks and rate limiting for scalability
- **🛡️ Resilient Design**: Graceful degradation when external services fail

## 🚀 Caching Strategy

Smart caching implementation that reduces external API calls and database load while maintaining data freshness.

### 🤖 **ML Predictions Caching** (`src/entities/rides/ride.mlService.ts:27-41`)
- **Cache Duration**: 1 hour for prediction stability
- **Fallback Strategy**: Serves stale data when external ML API fails
- **Key Format**: `ml:prediction:${originZone}:${destinationZone}:${hourOfDay}`
- **Benefits**: Reduces API calls and ensures consistent predictions

### 📊 **Driver Statistics Caching** (`src/entities/stats/stats.service.ts`)
- **Cache Duration**: 5 minutes for real-time dashboard accuracy
- **Purpose**: Eliminates redundant complex aggregation queries
- **Key Format**: `stats:earnings:${driverId}:${view}:${startDate}:${endDate}`
- **Impact**: Significantly faster dashboard load times

## 🗄️ Database Performance

Optimized database configuration and query patterns for maximum efficiency.

### 🔗 **Connection Pooling**
- **Development**: 5-20 connections for local development efficiency
- **Production**: 10-50 connections for high-traffic handling
- **Benefits**: Eliminates connection overhead and improves response times

### 🎯 **Strategic Indexing**
Unique partial indexes that enforce business rules while optimizing queries:
- **Active Rides**: `rides(shift_id) WHERE end_time IS NULL`
- **Active Shifts**: `shifts(driver_id) WHERE shift_end IS NULL`
- **Purpose**: Combines constraint enforcement with query optimization

### ⚡ **Query Optimization**
- **Result Limiting**: Automatic 1000-record limit prevents memory issues
- **Eager Loading**: Prevents N+1 query problems through strategic includes
- **Batch Operations**: Groups related operations for efficiency

## ⚡ Asynchronous Processing

Non-blocking operations that maintain system responsiveness under load.

### 🔄 **Background Tasks**
- **Data Cleanup**: Runs asynchronously during user login
- **Batch Processing**: Groups individual updates into efficient batch operations
- **Benefits**: Improved user experience and system responsiveness

### 🚦 **Rate Limiting**
- **Limit**: 100 requests per 15-minute window per IP address
- **Scope**: Applied to all `/api/` routes for comprehensive protection
- **Response**: Returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when exceeded
- **Purpose**: Prevents abuse and ensures fair resource distribution

## 🛡️ Graceful Degradation

Resilient architecture that maintains functionality when external dependencies fail.

### 📊 **Service Failure Handling**
- **🔴 Redis Unavailable**: Automatically skips caching and computes fresh data
- **🤖 ML API Down**: Returns sensible default prediction values
- **📍 Hotspot API Fails**: Falls back to cached database records
- **📈 Benefits**: Zero-downtime operation despite external service issues
