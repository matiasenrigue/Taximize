# Testing Strategy

This project follows a comprehensive Test-Driven Development methodology that ensures code quality, reliability, and maintainability across all entities and services.

## 🎯 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

Our enhanced four-phase TDD approach goes beyond traditional red-green-refactor cycles:

### 📋 **1. Planning Phase** *(Enhanced TDD Addition)*
Before writing any code or tests, we document the expected behavior in plain English, clearly defining feature requirements and acceptance criteria.

### 🔴 **2. Red Phase**
Write a failing test that defines the desired functionality:
- Start with the simplest test case
- Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
- Ensure test failure for the right reasons

### 🟢 **3. Green Phase**
Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass:
- Implement only what's needed to satisfy the test
- Keep the implementation simple and straightforward
- Prioritize functionality over optimization

### 🔄 **4. Refactor Phase**
Improve the code while keeping tests green:
- Remove duplication and improve readability
- Optimize performance where needed
- Ensure all tests continue to pass

## 🏗️ Test Organization

The project maintains a clear separation between different types of tests to ensure comprehensive coverage:

### 🔬 **Unit Tests**
- **Location**: `tests/unit/` directories within each entity
- **Purpose**: Focus on testing individual components in isolation
- **Scope**: Single functions, methods, or small units of functionality

### 🔗 **Integration Tests**
- **Location**: `tests/integration/` directories within each entity
- **Purpose**: Test the interaction between multiple components
- **Scope**: API endpoints, database interactions, service integrations

## ⚙️ Running Tests

### 🚀 **Common Commands**

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test.ts
```

### 🎯 **Targeted Testing**

```bash
# Run tests for specific entity
npm test -- src/entities/auth

# Run only unit tests
npm test -- tests/unit

# Run only integration tests
npm test -- tests/integration
```
